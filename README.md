# javaScript Quiz
## About the project
The goal of this aplication was to create a timed quiz with a scoreboard that could save the users results with their initials in localstorage. I struggled with this one and ended up spending 2 weeks on it instead of 1. I couldnt decide where the best place to start was so I kept starting over. I know I can get it to function properly but ive spent too much time on it as it is. This project helped to enforce the importance of writing down what you need to make it function before starting, and breaking it into indivdual sections.
